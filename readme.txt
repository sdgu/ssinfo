pin is not encrypted, meant as a soft measure so only you can edit your entries
weak captcha, just checking the input text against predetermined text
if there's an error, the form is repopulated by remembering everything in it and using js innerHTML / value to put the entries back in--probably not the way to do it

means refreshing could lead to forms having entries from another user

bottom name is newest user to submit: make sure yours went through

made for a small scale of like 10-15 people
